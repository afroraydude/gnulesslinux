# gnulesslinux
A Linux Distribution with a non-GNU Userland created by [afroraydude](https://github.com/afroraydude)

## Why? 
Because in some ways a GNU userland could be seen as bloated or too large, therefore I have decided to create a system that replaces the core GNU packages found in most Linux distributions. 

## Download
Downloads will be available on my repo found [here](https://packages.afroraydude.com).

## More details about the system
The system will use [uspm](https://github.com/afroraydude/uspm) as its package manager. It will be shell-only for now.
