    <p>
        Wombat Linux is a lightweight Linux distrobution that attempts to be lightweight and 
        run on all types of (for now, x86_64) systems. It relies on musl-libc over glibc
        and replaces the usual GNU Coreutils with the Heirloom Project, with BusyBox as a planned
        alternative.
